EXCEPTION HANDLING

-> Mechanism to handle errors in programs that occur at runtime.
-> These errors are called exceptions.
-> Exist outside the normal functioning of the program.
-> Require immediate handling by the program.
-> If not hand led, the program will crash.
-> Cannot be ignored, unlike C error handling.

MECHANISM

Try Block
-> Creates a scope/block & exception causing code appears here.
-> Can contain other try-catch blocks.

Throw Block
-> Throws an exception from the try block.
-> Exception is object that is constructed in throw statement.

Catch Block
-> Handler that catches the exception object.
-> Should appear just after the try block.
-> Multiple catch blocks can be used.
