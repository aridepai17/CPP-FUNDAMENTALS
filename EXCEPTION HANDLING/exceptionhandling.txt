EXCEPTION HANDLING

-> Mechanism to handle errors in programs that occur at runtime.
-> These errors are called exceptions.
-> Exist outside the normal functioning of the program.
-> Require immediate handling by the program.
-> If not hand led, the program will crash.
-> Cannot be ignored, unlike C error handling.

MECHANISM

Try Block
-> Creates a scope/block & exception causing code appears here.
-> Can contain other try-catch blocks.

Throw Block
-> Throws an exception from the try block.
-> Exception is object that is constructed in throw statement.

Catch Block
-> Handler that catches the exception object.
-> Should appear just after the try block.
-> Multiple catch blocks can be used.

noexcept Keyword

-> Applied to functions ( both in declaration & definition).
-> Indicates the function does not throw exceptions.
-> Compiler can optimize the function.
    -> No need to generate stack unwinding code.
-> An exception from such function terminates the program.
    -> Stack may or may not be unwound.
-> Not all functions should use the noexcept specifier.
    -> Especially functions calling other functions ( in library )
    -> Such functions will be exception-neutral.
