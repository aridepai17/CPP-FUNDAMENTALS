NON STATIC DATA MEMBER INITIALIZERS
-> Convienient way of initializing class members with values during declaration.
class Class{
    <type1><var1> {<initializer>};
    <type2><var2> = <initializer>;
-> Ensures the memvers intialized with valid values.
-> Can be used to initialize any type.
-> Compiler automatiaclly generates intialization code.
-> initialization in a user-defined constructor takes precedence.
