OPERATOR OVERLOADING 
-> Custom implementation for primitive operators.
-> Allows usage of user-defined objects in mathematical expressions.
-> Overloaded as functions but provide a convenient notation.
-> Implemented as member or global functions.
-> Require usage of the operator keyword.

SYNTAX
<ret> operator <#> (<arguments>)

-> As global functions, require same number of arguments as the operands.
-> As member functions, one operand is passed as argument through this pointer.
    -> Binary operator will require only one explicit argument.
    -> Unary operator will not require any explicit argument.

Integer operator + ( const Integer &, ocnst Integer & ) - Global function
Integer Integer::operator + ( const Integer & ) - Member function
