RULES OF OPERATOR OVERLOADING
-> Associativity, Precedence, and Arity ( operand count ) does not change.
-> Operator functions should be non-static
    -> except new and delete.
-> One argument should be user defined type.
-> Global overload if first operand is primitive type.
-> Not all operators can be overloaded.
    -> . ? : .* sizeof
-> Cannot define new operators.
-> Overloaded for conventional behaviour only.
