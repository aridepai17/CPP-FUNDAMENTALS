RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
-> Some classes own a resource.
-> This resource may be a pointer, file handle, socket, etc.
-> Such resources may be acquird in the constructor.
-> Subsequently, you have to decide the aciton in case objects of such classes ate cipied, moved or destroyed.
eg: On destruction,the resource msut be realeased to avoitd leaks.
-> Similarly, on copy or move the resource msut be handl ed accordingly.

RULE OF 5
-> Consequently, you should implement the rule of 5 for such classes.
-> If a calss had ownership semantics, then you msut provide a user-defined
    -> Destructor
    -> Copy constructor
    -> Copy assignment operator.
    -> Move  constructor
    -> Move assignment operator.
-> This is to ensure proper handling of the underlying resource.

RULE OF 0
-> If a class does not have ownership semantics, then do not provide any user defined function from the rule of 5.
-> This is called Rule of 0.
-> This way the compiler will automatically synthesize the necessary fucntions.
-> Providing user-defined implementation of some fucntions wil prevent the compiler form synthesizing others.
