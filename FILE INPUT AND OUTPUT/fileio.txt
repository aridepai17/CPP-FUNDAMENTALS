FILE I/O

-> C++ provides support for file I/O through following classes:
    -> ofstream - write to an output stream.
    -> ifstream - read from an input stream.
    -> fstream - both read and write to an input stream.
-> Include <fstream> header file to use these classes.
-> All classes can be used for both text and binary I/O.
-> Additionally, they support modes that decide how the file is opened and operated.
-> is_open() function returns a boolean value indicating if a stream is open.

STREAM STATE FLAGS

-> goodbit -> No error -> bool good()
-> badbit -> Irreversible error -> bool bad()
-> failbit -> I/O operation failed -> bool fail()
-> eofbit -> End of file reached -> bool eof()
