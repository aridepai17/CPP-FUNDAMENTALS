STATIC MEMBER VARIABLES
-> Member variables qualified with the static keyword.
-> Not part of the object.
-> Belong to the class.
-> Only one copy of the member variable exists in the class.
-> Shared between objects.
-> Cannot be initialized inside the class.
-> Have to be defined outside the class for initalization.
-> Default initialization assigns default value of the type.

// Car.h
class Car{
    static int totalCars;
}
// Car.cpp
int Car::totalCars; // Default init to 0

STATIC MEMBER FUNCTIONS
-> Static member functions qualified with the static keyword.
-> Required only in declaration.
-> Belong to the class and not to the objects.
-> Do not receive this pointer.
-> Cannot access non-static members of the class.
-> Can be invoked directly through the class name.
