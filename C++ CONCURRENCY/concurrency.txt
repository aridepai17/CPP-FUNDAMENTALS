C++ CONCURRENCY 

-> Large applications have multiple components.
-> Some componenets may have to execute concurrently.
-> This allows efficient usage of the CPU.
-> This can be achieved by using multiple threads.
-> C++ added support for concurrency.
-> Includes utilities for starting and managing threads.

std::thread

-> Accepts a callable as constructor argument.
-> The callable is executed in a separate thread.
-> The constructor does not wait for the thread to start; it returns immediately.
-> Resides in <thread> header.
