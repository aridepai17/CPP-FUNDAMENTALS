L-VALUES
-> Has a name.
-> All variables are l-values.
-> Can be assigned values.
-> Some expressions returns l-values.
-> L-value persists beyond the expression.
-> Functions that return by reference return l-values.
-> Reference to l-value (also called l-value reference).

R-VALUES 
-> Does not have a name.
-> R-values are temporary values.
-> Cannot be assigned values.
-> Some expressions returns r-values.
-> R-value does not persist beyond the expression.
-> Functions that return by value return r-values.
-> Reference to r-value (also called r-value reference).

R-VALUE REFERENCE ( MOVE SEMANTICS )
-> A reference created to a temporary.
-> Represents a temporary.
-> Created with && operator.
-> Cannot point to l-values.
-> R-value references always bind to temporaries.
-> L-value references always bind to l-values.
eg: int &&a = 10; // R-value reference
    int &b = Add(3,5) // Add returns by values
    int &&c = 3+4 // Expression returns a temporary
