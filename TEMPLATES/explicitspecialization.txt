EXPLICIT SPECIALIZATION 

-> Template specialized for a particular type.
-> Provides correct semantics for some datatype.
-> Or implement an algorithm optimally for a specific type.
-> Explicitly specialized functions must be defined in a .cpp file.
-> Primary template definition should occur before specialization.
