UNIONS IN C++

-> Gives the ability to represent all the members in the same members.
-> Saves space.
-> Several DISADVANTAGES -
    -> No way to know which type it holds.
    -> Nested types with non-default constructors deletes the defauly constructor of the union.
    -> Cannot assign objects of user-defined types directly to a union member.
    -> Cannot have a base class.
    -> Cannot derive from a union.
