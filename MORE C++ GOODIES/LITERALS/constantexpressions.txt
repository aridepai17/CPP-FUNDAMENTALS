constexpr

-> Represents an expression that is constant.
-> Such expressions are possibly evaluated at compile time.
-> Can be applied to variable decalarations or functions.
-> May increase the performance of the code as computation is done at compile time.

CONSTANT EXPRESSION FUNCTION RULES

-> Should accept and return literal types only.
-> Should contain only single line statement that should be a return statement.
-> constexpr functions are implicitly inline.

const VS constexpr

-> Initialization of a const variable can be deferred until runtime.
-> However, a constexpr variable must be initialized at compile time.
-> All constexpr variables are const but not all const variables are constexpr.
-> Use const keyword to indicate the value cannot be modified .
-> USe constexpr keyword to create expressions that can be evaluated at compile time.
