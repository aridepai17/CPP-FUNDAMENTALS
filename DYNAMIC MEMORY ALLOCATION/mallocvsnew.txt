malloc()
-> malloc() is a function.
-> Requires size during allocation.
-> Cannot initialize memory.
-> Cannot call constructors.
-> Returns void pointer that need to be type casted.
-> Cannot be customized.
-> malloc(), calloc() and realloc() all return void pointers.
-> malloc() returns NULL on failure.

new
-> new is an operator.
-> Size is ascertained from the type.
-> Can initialize memory.
-> Can call constructors.
-> Returns correct type of pointer.
-> Can be customized through overloading.
-> Has different forms.
-> new throws exception on failure.

In conclusion, new is SUPERIOR to malloc() in every way and is THE BEST option and we should NEVER use
malloc() in C++.
